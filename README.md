# NFL team embedding project

## Summary
This project is for the doctoral dissertation. The purpose of this project is to build a model that predicts future team performance based on hierarchical collaboration networks. Focusing on the hierarchical nature of collaboration networks, this work is the first attempt to learn vector representations of teams based on individual team membersâ€™ characteristics and how they are organized into a hierarchical team. We validated our model on National Football League (NFL) coach collaboration dataset. We learned the team embeddings based on the coaches' individual characteristics and their hierarchical collaboration patterns, then predicted the teams' seasonal failure during the regular seasons.
